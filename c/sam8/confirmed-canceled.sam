;;HELP
;#000 This is the help for the confirmed/cancel functions
;
;It demonstrates how to use these two functions to discriminate
;between each of the three possible outcomes of the confirmation
;
;#001
; The confirmed() function will return 1 (TRUE) ONLY when the [OK]
; button is selected
;
; It will return 0 (FALSE) for the other two buttons.
;
; In that case, the canceled() function will return 1 (TRUE)
; if the [CANCEL] button, or the <ESCAPE> key was used
;
;#002 More help on the big question
;
;This help chapter will tell you a bit more about
;what it is all about in this test script
;
;It is really meant to show you how to incorporate
;a compact section of help-texts into a DFSee script
;that can be called up with the F1 function key
;by the user
;
;Multiple numbered sections can exist, that can be used
;with different messages of confirmations in the script
;
