TxWindows version 5 distribution (Open source)

Includes the library, sources and samples.

Unzip the 'txwcsam.zip' and 'txwinlib' ZIP files from the archive
to the ROOT of any drive with enough space (roughly 200Mb)

Unzip the 'txwtools.zip' either to that same dirctory (and add to PATH)
or unzip it in a 'tools' directory already in the PATH.

Then update the '\c\setenvtx.cmd' script to match the driveletter.
(or call it with the correct parameters to do that)

When using an seperate OS2 toolkit (not from Openwatcom)
you need to set the TOOLKIT environment variable before
calling the setenvtx.cmd script.
