TxWindows version 7 distribution (Open source, MIT license)

Includes the library, sources and samples.

Unzip the 'txwcsam.zip' and 'txwinlib' ZIP files from the archive into
an instalation directory of your choice (can be ROOT or a subdirectory)
with enough space (roughly 200Mb)

Unzip the 'txwtools.zip' either to that same directory (and add to PATH)
or unzip it in a 'tools' directory already in the PATH.

Then update the 'install-path\c\setenvtx.cmd' script to match the driveletter
and path to the 'c' subdirectory in the actual installation directory.
(or call it with the correct parameters to do that)

When using an seperate OS2 toolkit (not from Openwatcom)
you need to set the TOOLKIT environment variable before
calling the setenvtx.cmd script.


Note that the 'TXT' sample/test program contains the executables
for all supported platforms (in the '_build_' subdirectory), so
so you can see how it looks without having to build anything yet.
